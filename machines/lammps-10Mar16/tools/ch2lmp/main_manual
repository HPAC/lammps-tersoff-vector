The charmm2lmp sub-directory contains tools for converting files back-and-forth between
the CHARMM MD code and LAMMPS.

The charmm2lammps.pl perl script converts CHARMM input files into LAMMPS input.
The lammps2pdb.pl perl script converts LAMMPS dump files into a pdb series file.
The mkpdb.f fortran 90 code also converts LAMMPS dump files into PDB files, and the 
mkdcd.f tool converts LAMMPS dump files into CHARMM *.dcd trajectory files that can
be read-in to CHARMM for analysis. See the README file in the charmm2lmp sub-directory
for more information.

These tools were written by Pieter J. in 't Veld (pjintve@sandia.gov) and Paul Crozier
(pscrozi@sandia.gov) at Sandia.
