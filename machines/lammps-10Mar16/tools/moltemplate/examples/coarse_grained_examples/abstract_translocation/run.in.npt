# I'm not sure which way is more correct, however

#fix Ffreezestuff groupB rigid single force * off off off torque * off off off dilate mobile

# The use of either "fix rigid" or "fix rigid/npt" to immobilize
# an object is somewhat controversial.  Feel free to omit it.
#(Neither Trung or Steve Plimpton use rigid or rigid/npt for immobilizing 
#molecules, but I noticed that at NPT, it does a better job of maintaining 
# the correct volume. However "fix rigid" has changed since then (2011), 
# so this may no longer be true.  Please use this example with caution.)

# IMPORTANT for NPT: You must use "neigh_modify" to turn off calculation of the
#                    forces between immobilized atoms.
