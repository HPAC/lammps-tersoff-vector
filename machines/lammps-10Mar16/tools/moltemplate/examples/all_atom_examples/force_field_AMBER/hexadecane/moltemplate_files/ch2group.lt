# The "gaff.lt" file is usually located in $MOLTEMPLATE_PATH (and is 
# distributed with moltemplate. See the "Installation" section in the manual.)
# It contains definitions of the atoms "c3", "hc", as well as the force-field
# parameters for bonded and non-bonded interactions between them 
# (and many other atoms).

# Atom charges were taken from the OPLSAA force field file:
# http://dasher.wustl.edu/tinker/distribution/params/oplsaa.prm

  #  Note: The "..." in "$mol:..." tells moltemplate that this molecule may
  #        be a part of a larger molecule, and (if so) to use the larger
  #        parent object's molecule id number as it's own.
  #        The CH2 group is part of the Hexadecane molecule.

  # Now specify which pairs of atoms are bonded:
  write('Data Bond List') {
    $bond:CH1 $atom:C $atom:H1
    $bond:CH2 $atom:C $atom:H2

} # CH2


# Optional: Shift all the coordinates in the +Y direction by 0.4431163.
#           This way, the carbon atom is no longer located at 0,0,0, but the
#           axis of an alkane chain containing this monomer is at 0,0,0.
#           (This makes it more convenient to construct a polymer later.
#            If this is confusing, then simply add 0.4431163 to the Y 
#            coordinates in the "Data Atoms" section above.)
