import "gaff.lt"

# The "gaff.lt" file is usually located in $MOLTEMPLATE_PATH (and is 
# distributed with moltemplate. See the "Installation" section in the manual.)
# It contains definitions of the atoms "c2", "hc", as well as the bonded
# and non-bonded interactions between them (and many other atoms).
#
# Moltemplate is only a simple text manipulation tool.  It cannot
# calculate atomic charge using quantom chemistry methods.
# Atom charges for this example were taken from the OPLSAA force field file:
# http://dasher.wustl.edu/tinker/distribution/params/oplsaa.prm
# However, normally simulations in AMBER are assigned charges using the
# "HF/6-31G* RESP2" or "AM1-BCC3" methods using AmberTools.
