# THIS EXAMPLE HAS NOT BEEN RIGOROUSLY TESTED.
# (This simulation may fail.
#  However the "run.in.nvt" example in this directory should work.)
#
#        Requirements:
# To run this system at constant pressure, it might help to compile LAMMPS with
# the optional RIGID package, and use "fix rigid" on the carbon.  (Optional.)
# The use of fix rigid is controversial.  This method is demonstrated below.

# Only the Cgraphene atoms are immobile.
group mobile subtract all Cgraphene

# (Note: The "Cgraphene" group was defined in system.in.settings.)


# Unfortunately you can not use the LAMMPS "minimize" command on this system
# because there is no way to immobilize the carbon graphene & nanotube atoms
# during minimization.  Instead, we can use langevin dynamics with a large 
# damping parameter and a small timestep.

#     -- Alternate npt rigid method --
# I'm not sure which way is more correct, however 
# this also seems to behave in a reasonable-looking way:
#fix Ffreezestuff Cgraphene rigid single force * off off off torque * off off off
#
# The use of either "fix rigid" or "fix rigid/npt" to immobilize
# an object is somewhat controversial.  Feel free to omit it.
#(Neither Trung or Steve Plimpton use rigid or rigid/npt for immobilizing 
#molecules, but I noticed that at NPT, it does a better job of maintaining 
# the correct volume. However "fix rigid" has changed since then (2011), 
# so this may no longer be true.  Please use this example with caution.)
#  ----------------------------------------

# IMPORTANT for NPT: You must use "neigh_modify" to turn off calculation of the
#                    forces between immobilized atoms.
neigh_modify exclude group Cgraphene Cgraphene

# The next two lines recalculate the temperature 
# using only the mobile degrees of freedom:
