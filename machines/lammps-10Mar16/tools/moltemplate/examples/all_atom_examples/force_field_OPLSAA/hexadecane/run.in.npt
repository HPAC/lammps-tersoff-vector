# PREREQUISITES:

#     You must use moltemplate.sh to create 3 files:
#        system.data  system.in.init  system.in.settings
#     (Follow the instructions in README_setup.sh, 
#      or run the file as a script using ./README_setup.sh)

# To avoid explosions, I have a 4-step equilibraion process (expand, minimize, 
# reorient, compress).  The system (as defined in the "system.data" file) 
# is already expanded.  That means there are 3 steps left:

# Note: In general, it's always a good idea to minimize the system at first.

# To speed it up, I randomize the atomic positions for a few thousand steps 
# using fix langevin (and fix nve).  Then I switch to fix nvt (Nose-Hoover).
# (If I start with fix nvt (Nose-Hoover), it seems to get "stuck" for a while.)

# -- equilibration part 3: Equilibrating the density (NPT) --

# Originally, the simulation box (in "system.data" and "system.lt") was 
# unrealistically large.  The spacing between the molecules was large also.
# I did this to enable the molecules to move freely and reorient themselves.
# After doing that, we should run the simulation under NPT conditions to 
# allow the simulation box to contract to it's natural size.  We do that here:
# We begin the simulation at 100 barr (a relatively low pressure), and
# slowly decrease it to 1 barr, maintianing the temperature at 300K.
