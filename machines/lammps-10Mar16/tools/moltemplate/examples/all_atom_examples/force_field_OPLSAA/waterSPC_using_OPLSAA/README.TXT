The purpose of this example is to test the density of water 
constructed using the OPLSAA force-field.  (I think this is SPC water, not SPCE)

I just wanted some kind of sanity check to make sure we are converting
the OPLSAA parameters into moltemplate/LAMMPS format correctly.

The "TEST_density_estimate.txt" contains the results of that test.

More detailed instructions on how to build LAMMPS input files and 
run a short simulation are provided in other README files.
