# Open up the PDB file to count the number of water molecules inside.  (Or just
# divide the number of atoms by 3). Put that in between the brackets ("[260]")
#
# The command above does not set the positions of the atoms.
# So they will have to be loaded later from a PDB or an XYZ file.
# (For example, using "moltemplate.sh -pdb solvate.pdb system.lt")
