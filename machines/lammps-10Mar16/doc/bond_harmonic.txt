bond_style harmonic command :h3
bond_style harmonic/intel command :h3
bond_style harmonic/kk command :h3
bond_style harmonic/omp command :h3

[Syntax:]

bond_style harmonic :pre

[Examples:]

bond_style harmonic
bond_coeff 5 80.0 1.2 :pre

[Description:]

The {harmonic} bond style uses the potential

:c,image(Eqs/bond_harmonic.jpg)

where r0 is the equilibrium bond distance.  Note that the usual 1/2
factor is included in K.

The following coefficients must be defined for each bond type via the
"bond_coeff"_bond_coeff.html command as in the example above, or in
the data file or restart files read by the "read_data"_read_data.html
or "read_restart"_read_restart.html commands:

K (energy/distance^2)
r0 (distance) :ul

:line

Styles with a {cuda}, {gpu}, {intel}, {kk}, {omp}, or {opt} suffix are
functionally the same as the corresponding style without the suffix.
They have been optimized to run faster, depending on your available
hardware, as discussed in "Section_accelerate"_Section_accelerate.html
of the manual.  The accelerated styles take the same arguments and
should produce the same results, except for round-off and precision
issues.

These accelerated styles are part of the USER-CUDA, GPU, USER-INTEL,
KOKKOS, USER-OMP and OPT packages, respectively.  They are only
enabled if LAMMPS was built with those packages.  See the "Making
LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#start_3 section for more info.

You can specify the accelerated styles explicitly in your input script
by including their suffix, or you can use the "-suffix command-line
switch"_Section_start.html#start_7 when you invoke LAMMPS, or you can
use the "suffix"_suffix.html command in your input script.

See "Section_accelerate"_Section_accelerate.html of the manual for
more instructions on how to use the accelerated styles effectively.

[Restrictions:]

This bond style can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the
MOLECULE package (which it is by default).  See the "Making
LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#start_3 section for more info on packages.

[Related commands:]

"bond_coeff"_bond_coeff.html, "delete_bonds"_delete_bonds.html

[Default:] none
