:line

log command :h3

[Syntax:]

log file keyword :pre

file = name of new logfile
keyword = {append} if output should be appended to logfile (optional) :ul

[Examples:]

log log.equil
log log.equil append :pre

[Description:]

This command closes the current LAMMPS log file, opens a new file with
the specified name, and begins logging information to it.  If the
specified file name is {none}, then no new log file is opened.  If the
optional keyword {append} is specified, then output will be appended
to an existing log file, instead of overwriting it.

If multiple processor partitions are being used, the file name should
be a variable, so that different processors do not attempt to write to
the same log file.

The file "log.lammps" is the default log file for a LAMMPS run.  The
name of the initial log file can also be set by the command-line
switch -log.  See "Section_start 6"_Section_start.html#start_7 for
details.

[Restrictions:] none

[Related commands:] none

[Default:]

The default LAMMPS log file is named log.lammps
