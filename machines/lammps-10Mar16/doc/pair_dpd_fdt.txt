pair_style dpd/fdt command :h3
pair_style dpd/fdt/energy command :h3

[Syntax:]

pair_style style args :pre

style = {dpd/fdt} or {dpd/fdt/energy}
args = list of arguments for a particular style :ul
  {dpd/fdt} args = T cutoff seed
    T = temperature (temperature units)
    cutoff = global cutoff for DPD interactions (distance units)
    seed = random # seed (positive integer)
  {dpd/fdt/energy} args = cutoff seed
    cutoff = global cutoff for DPD interactions (distance units)
    seed = random # seed (positive integer) :pre

[Examples:]

pair_style dpd/fdt 300.0 2.5 34387
pair_coeff * * 3.0 1.0 2.5 :pre

pair_style dpd/fdt/energy 2.5 34387
pair_coeff * * 3.0 1.0 0.1 2.5 :pre

[Description:]

Styles {dpd/fdt} and {dpd/fdt/energy} set the fluctuation-dissipation
theorem parameters and compute the conservative force for dissipative
particle dynamics (DPD). The conservative force on atom I due to atom
J is given by

:c,image(Eqs/pair_dpd_conservative.jpg)

where the weighting factor, omega_ij, varies between 0 and 1, and is
chosen to have the following functional form:

:c,image(Eqs/pair_dpd_omega.jpg)

where Rij is a unit vector in the direction Ri - Rj, and Rc is the
cutoff.  Note that alternative definitions of the weighting function
exist, but would have to be implemented as a separate pair style
command.

These pair style differ from the other dpd styles in that the
dissipative and random forces are not computed within the pair style.
This style can be combined with the "fix shardlow"_fix_shardlow.html
to perform the stochastic integration of the dissipative and random
forces through the Shardlow splitting algorithm approach.

The pairwise energy associated with styles {dpd/fdt} and
{dpd/fdt/energy} is only due to the conservative force term Fc, and is
shifted to be zero at the cutoff distance Rc.  The pairwise virial is
calculated using only the conservative term.

For style {dpd/fdt}, the fluctuation-dissipation theorem defines gamma
to be set equal to sigma*sigma/(2 T), where T is the set point
temperature specified as a pair style parameter in the above examples.
This style can be combined with "fix shardlow"_fix_shardlow.html to
perform DPD simulations under isothermal and isobaric conditions (see
"(Lisal)"_#Lisal).  The following coefficients must be defined for
each pair of atoms types via the "pair_coeff"_pair_coeff.html command
as in the examples above, or in the data file or restart files read by
the "read_data"_read_data.html or "read_restart"_read_restart.html
commands:

A (force units)
sigma (force*time^(1/2) units)
cutoff (distance units) :ul

The last coefficient is optional.  If not specified, the global DPD
cutoff is used.

For style {dpd/fdt/energy}, the fluctuation-dissipation theorem
defines gamma to be set equal to sigma*sigma/(2 dpdTheta), where
dpdTheta is the average internal temperature for the pair.
Furthermore, the fluctuation-dissipation defines alpha*alpha to be set
equal to 2*kB*kappa, where kappa is the mesoparticle thermal
conductivity parameter.  This style can be combined with "fix
shardlow"_fix_shardlow.html to perform DPD simulations under
isoenergetic and isoenthalpic conditions (see "(Lisal)"_#Lisal).  The
following coefficients must be defined for each pair of atoms types
via the "pair_coeff"_pair_coeff.html command as in the examples above,
or in the data file or restart files read by the
"read_data"_read_data.html or "read_restart"_read_restart.html
commands:

A (force units)
sigma (force*time^(1/2) units)
kappa (1/time units)
cutoff (distance units) :ul

The last coefficient is optional.  If not specified, the global DPD
cutoff is used.

For style {dpd/fdt/energy}, the particle internal temperature is
related to the particle internal energy through a mesoparticle
equation of state.  Thus, an an additional "fix eos"_fix.html must be
specified.

[Restrictions:]

Pair styles {dpd/fdt} and {dpd/fdt/energy} are only available if
LAMMPS is built with the USER-DPD package.

Pair styles {dpd/fdt} and {dpd/fdt/energy} require use of the
"communicate vel yes"_communicate.html option so that velocites are
stored by ghost atoms.

Pair style {dpd/fdt/energy} requires "atom_style dpd"_atom_style.html
to be used in order to properly account for the particle internal
energies and temperatures.
