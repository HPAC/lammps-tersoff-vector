info command :h3

[Syntax:]

info args :pre

args = one or more of the following keywords: {out}, {all}, {system}, {communication}, {computes}, {dumps}, {fixes}, {groups}, {regions}, {variables}, {time}, or {configuration}
     {out} values = {screen}, {log}, {append} filename, {overwrite} filename:ul

[Examples:]

info system
info groups computes variables
info all out log
info all out append info.txt :pre

[Description:]

Print out information about the current internal state of the running
LAMMPS process. This can be helpful when debugging or validating
complex input scripts.  Several output categories are available and
one or more output category may be requested.

The {out} flag controls where the output is sent. It can only be sent
to one target. By default this is the screen, if it is active. The
{log} argument selects the log file instead. With the {append} and
{overwrite} option, followed by a filename, the output is written
to that file, which is either appended to or overwritten, respectively.

The {all} flag activates printing all categories listed below.

The {system} category prints a general system overview listing.  This
includes the unit style, atom style, number of atoms, bonds, angles,
dihedrals, and impropers and the number of the respective types, box
dimensions and properties, force computing styles and more.

The {communication} category prints a variety of information about
communication and parallelization: the MPI library version level,
the number of MPI ranks and OpenMP threads, the communication style
and layout, the processor grid dimensions, ghost atom communication
mode, cutoff, and related settings.

The {computes} category prints a list of all currently defined
computes, their IDs and styles and groups they operate on.

The {dumps} category prints a list of all currently active dumps,
their IDs, styles, filenames, groups, and dump frequencies.

The {fixes} category prints a list of all currently defined fixes,
their IDs and styles and groups they operate on.

The {groups} category prints a list of all currently defined groups.

The {regions} category prints a list of all currently defined regions,
their IDs and styles and whether "inside" or "outside" atoms are
selected.

The {variables} category prints a list of all currently defined
variables, their names, styles, definition and last computed value, if
available.

The {time} category prints the accumulated CPU and wall time for the
process that writes output (usually MPI rank 0).

The {configuration} command prints some information about the LAMMPS
version and architection and OS it is run on. Where supported, also
information about the memory consumption provided by the OS is
reported.

[Restrictions:] none
