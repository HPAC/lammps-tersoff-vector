fix momentum command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID group-ID momentum N keyword values ... :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command :ulb,l
momentum = style name of this fix command :l
N = adjust the momentum every this many timesteps
one or more keyword/value pairs may be appended :l
keyword = {linear} or {angular} or {rescale} :l
  {linear} values = xflag yflag zflag
    xflag,yflag,zflag = 0/1 to exclude/include each dimension
  {angular} values = none :pre
  {rescale} values = none :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

fix 1 all momentum 1 linear 1 1 0
fix 1 all momentum 1 linear 1 1 1 rescale
fix 1 all momentum 100 linear 1 1 1 angular :pre

[Description:]

Zero the linear and/or angular momentum of the group of atoms every N
timesteps by adjusting the velocities of the atoms.  One (or both) of
the {linear} or {angular} keywords must be specified.

If the {linear} keyword is used, the linear momentum is zeroed by
subtracting the center-of-mass velocity of the group from each atom.
This does not change the relative velocity of any pair of atoms.  One
or more dimensions can be excluded from this operation by setting the
corresponding flag to 0.

If the {angular} keyword is used, the angular momentum is zeroed by
subtracting a rotational component from each atom.

This command can be used to insure the entire collection of atoms (or
a subset of them) does not drift or rotate during the simulation due
to random perturbations (e.g. "fix langevin"_fix_langevin.html
thermostatting).

The {rescale} keyword enables conserving the kinetic energy of the group
of atoms by rescaling the velocities after the momentum was removed.

Note that the "velocity"_velocity.html command can be used to create
initial velocities with zero aggregate linear and/or angular momentum.
