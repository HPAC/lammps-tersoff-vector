fix reax/bonds command :h3
fix reax/c/bonds command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID group-ID reax/bonds Nevery filename :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command
reax/bonds = style name of this fix command
Nevery = output interval in timesteps
filename = name of output file :ul

[Examples:]

fix 1 all reax/bonds 100 bonds.tatb
fix 1 all reax/c/bonds 100 bonds.reaxc :pre

[Description:]

Write out the bond information computed by the ReaxFF potential
specified by "pair_style reax"_pair_reax.html or "pair_style
reax/c"_pair_reax_c.html in the exact same format as the original
stand-alone ReaxFF code of Adri van Duin.  The bond information is
written to {filename} on timesteps that are multiples of {Nevery},
including timestep 0.  For time-averaged chemical species analysis,
please see the "fix species"_fix_species.html command.

The format of the output file should be self-explantory.

[Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:]

No information about this fix is written to "binary restart
files"_restart.html.  None of the "fix_modify"_fix_modify.html options
are relevant to this fix.  No global or per-atom quantities are stored
by this fix for access by various "output
commands"_Section_howto.html#howto_15.  No parameter of this fix can
be used with the {start/stop} keywords of the "run"_run.html command.
This fix is not invoked during "energy minimization"_minimize.html.

[Restrictions:]

The fix reax/bonds command requires that the "pair_style
reax"_pair_reax.html be invoked.  This fix is part of the REAX
package.  It is only enabled if LAMMPS was built with that package,
which also requires the REAX library be built and linked with LAMMPS.
The fix reax/c/bonds command requires that the "pair_style
reax/c"_pair_reax_c.html be invoked.  This fix is part of the
USER-REAXC package.  It is only enabled if LAMMPS was built with that
package.  See the "Making LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#start_3 section
for more info.
