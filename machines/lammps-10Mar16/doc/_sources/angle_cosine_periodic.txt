Syntax

   angle_style cosine/periodic

Examples

.. parsed-literal::

   angle_style cosine/periodic
   angle_coeff * 75.0 1 6

Description
"""""""""""

The *cosine/periodic* angle style uses the following potential, which
is commonly used in the :ref:`DREIDING <howto_4>` force
field, particularly for organometallic systems where *n* = 4 might be
used for an octahedral complex and *n* = 3 might be used for a
trigonal center:

   :align: center

where C, B and n are coefficients defined for each angle type.

See :ref:`(Mayo) <Mayo>` for a description of the DREIDING force field

The following coefficients must be defined for each angle type via the
:doc:`angle_coeff <angle_coeff>` command as in the example above, or in
the data file or restart files read by the :doc:`read_data <read_data>`
or :doc:`read_restart <read_restart>` commands:

* C (energy)
* B = 1 or -1
* n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 for periodicity

Note that the prefactor C is specified and not the overall force
constant K = C / n^2.  When B = 1, it leads to a minimum for the
linear geometry.  When B = -1, it leads to a maximum for the linear
geometry.


----------


Styles with a *cuda*, *gpu*, *intel*, *kk*, *omp*, or *opt* suffix are
functionally the same as the corresponding style without the suffix.
They have been optimized to run faster, depending on your available
hardware, as discussed in :doc:`Section_accelerate <Section_accelerate>`
of the manual.  The accelerated styles take the same arguments and
should produce the same results, except for round-off and precision
issues.

These accelerated styles are part of the USER-CUDA, GPU, USER-INTEL,
KOKKOS, USER-OMP and OPT packages, respectively.  They are only
enabled if LAMMPS was built with those packages.  See the :ref:`Making LAMMPS <start_3>` section for more info.

You can specify the accelerated styles explicitly in your input script
by including their suffix, or you can use the :ref:`-suffix command-line switch <start_7>` when you invoke LAMMPS, or you can
use the :doc:`suffix <suffix>` command in your input script.

See :doc:`Section_accelerate <Section_accelerate>` of the manual for
more instructions on how to use the accelerated styles effectively.

Restrictions
""""""""""""


This angle style can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the
MOLECULE package (which it is by default).  See the :ref:`Making LAMMPS <start_3>` section for more info on packages.
