Description
"""""""""""

Reset the timestep size every N steps during a run, so that no atom
moves further than Xmax, based on current atom velocities and forces.
This can be useful when starting from a configuration with overlapping
atoms, where forces will be large.  Or it can be useful when running
an impact simulation where one or more high-energy atoms collide with
a solid, causing a damage cascade.

This fix overrides the timestep size setting made by the
:doc:`timestep <timestep>` command.  The new timestep size *dt* is
computed in the following manner.

For each atom, the timestep is computed that would cause it to
displace *Xmax* on the next integration step, as a function of its
current velocity and force.  Since performing this calculation exactly
would require the solution to a quartic equation, a cheaper estimate
is generated.  The estimate is conservative in that the atom's
displacement is guaranteed not to exceed *Xmax*, though it may be
smaller.

Given this putative timestep for each atom, the minimum timestep value
across all atoms is computed.  Then the *Tmin* and *Tmax* bounds are
applied, if specified.  If one (or both) is specified as NULL, it is
not applied.

When the :doc:`run style <run_style>` is *respa*, this fix resets the
outer loop (largest) timestep, which is the same timestep that the
:doc:`timestep <timestep>` command sets.

Note that the cumulative simulation time (in time units), which
accounts for changes in the timestep size as a simulation proceeds,
can be accessed by the :doc:`thermo_style time <thermo_style>` keyword.

""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

No information about this fix is written to :doc:`binary restart files <restart>`.  None of the :doc:`fix_modify <fix_modify>` options
are relevant to this fix.

This fix computes a global scalar which can be accessed by various
:ref:`output commands <howto_15>`.  The scalar stores
the last timestep on which the timestep was reset to a new value.

The scalar value calculated by this fix is "intensive".

No parameter of this fix can be used with the *start/stop* keywords of
the :doc:`run <run>` command.  This fix is not invoked during :doc:`energy minimization <minimize>`.
