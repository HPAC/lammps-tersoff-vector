compute smd/triangle/mesh/vertices
==================================

Syntax
""""""

.. parsed-literal::

   compute ID group-ID smd/triangle/mesh/vertices

* ID, group-ID are documented in :doc:`compute <compute>` command
* smd/triangle/mesh/vertices = style name of this compute command

Examples
""""""""

.. parsed-literal::

   compute 1 all smd/triangle/mesh/vertices

Description
"""""""""""

Define a computation that returns the coordinates of the vertices
corresponding to the triangle-elements of a mesh created by the `fix smd/wall_surface <ls_>`_.

See `this PDF guide <USER/smd/SMD_LAMMPS_userguide.pdf>`_ to using Smooth
Mach Dynamics in LAMMPS.

**Output info:**

This compute returns a per-particle vector of vectors, which can be
accessed by any command that uses per-particle values from a compute as
input. See :ref:`How-to discussions, section 6.15 <howto_15>`
for an overview of LAMMPS output options.

The per-particle vector has nine entries, (x1/y1/z1), (x2/y2/z2), and
(x3/y3/z3) corresponding to the first, second, and third vertex of
each triangle.

It is only meaningful to use this compute for a group of particles
which is created via the `fix smd/wall_surface <ls_>`_ command.

The output of this compute can be used with the dump2vtk_tris tool to
generate a VTK representation of the smd/wall_surace mesh for
visualization purposes.

The values will be given in :doc:`units <units>` of distance.

Restrictions
""""""""""""


This compute is part of the USER-SMD package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the :ref:`Making LAMMPS <start_3>` section for more info.
