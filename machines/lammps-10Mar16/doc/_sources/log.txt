   log log.equil append

Description
"""""""""""

This command closes the current LAMMPS log file, opens a new file with
the specified name, and begins logging information to it.  If the
specified file name is *none*, then no new log file is opened.  If the
optional keyword *append* is specified, then output will be appended
to an existing log file, instead of overwriting it.

If multiple processor partitions are being used, the file name should
be a variable, so that different processors do not attempt to write to
the same log file.

The file "log.lammps" is the default log file for a LAMMPS run.  The
name of the initial log file can also be set by the command-line
switch -log.  See :ref:`Section_start 6 <start_7>` for
details.

Restrictions

 none

**Related commands:** none

The default LAMMPS log file is named log.lammps
