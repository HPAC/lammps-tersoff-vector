Description
"""""""""""

Restrain the motion of the specified sets of atoms by making them part
of a bond or angle or dihedral interaction whose strength can vary
over time during a simulation.  This is functionally equivalent to
creating a bond or angle or dihedral for the same atoms in a data
file, as specified by the :doc:`read_data <read_data>` command, albeit
with a time-varying pre-factor coefficient.  For the purpose of
forcefield parameter-fitting or mapping a molecular potential energy
surface, this fix reduces the hassle and risk associated with
modifying data files.  In other words, use this fix to temporarily
force a molecule to adopt a particular conformation.  To create a
permanent bond or angle or dihedral, you should modify the data file.

The group-ID specified by this fix is ignored.

The second example above applies a restraint to hold the dihedral
angle formed by atoms 1, 2, 3, and 4 near 120 degrees using a constant
restraint coefficient.  The fourth example applies similar restraints
to multiple dihedral angles using a restraint coefficient that
increases from 0.0 to 2000.0 over the course of the run.

.. note::

   Adding a force to atoms implies a change in their potential
   energy as they move due to the applied force field.  For dynamics via
   the :doc:`run <run>` command, this energy can be added to the system's
   potential energy for thermodynamic output (see below).  For energy
   minimization via the :doc:`minimize <minimize>` command, this energy
   must be added to the system's potential energy to formulate a
   self-consistent minimization problem (see below).

In order for a restraint to be effective, the restraint force must
typically be significantly larger than the forces associated with
conventional forcefield terms.  If the restraint is applied during a
dynamics run (as opposed to during an energy minimization), a large
restraint coefficient can significantly reduce the stable timestep
size, especially if the atoms are initially far from the preferred
conformation.  You may need to experiment to determine what value of K
works best for a given application.

For the case of finding a minimum energy structure for a single
molecule with particular restratins (e.g. for fitting forcefield
parameters or constructing a potential energy surface), commands such
as the following may be useful:

----------


The *bond* keyword applies a bond restraint to the specified atoms
using the same functional form used by the :doc:`bond_style harmonic <bond_harmonic>` command.  The potential associated with
the restraint is

.. image:: Eqs/bond_harmonic.jpg
   :align: center

with the following coefficients:

* K (energy/distance^2)
* r0 (distance)

K and r0 are specified with the fix.  Note that the usual 1/2 factor
is included in K.


----------


The *angle* keyword applies an angle restraint to the specified atoms
using the same functional form used by the :doc:`angle_style harmonic <angle_harmonic>` command.  The potential associated with
the restraint is

.. image:: Eqs/angle_harmonic.jpg
   :align: center

with the following coefficients:

* K (energy/radian^2)
* theta0 (degrees)

K and theta0 are specified with the fix.  Note that the usual 1/2
factor is included in K.


----------


The *dihedral* keyword applies a dihedral restraint to the specified
atoms using a simplified form of the function used by the
:doc:`dihedral_style charmm <dihedral_charmm>` command.  The potential
associated with the restraint is

.. image:: Eqs/dihedral_charmm.jpg
   :align: center

with the following coefficients:

* K (energy)
* n = 1
* d (degrees) = phi0 + 180

K and phi0 are specified with the fix.  Note that the value of n is
hard-wired to 1.  Also note that the energy will be a minimum when the
current dihedral angle phi is equal to phi0.

No information about this fix is written to :doc:`binary restart files <restart>`.

The :doc:`fix_modify <fix_modify>` *energy* option is supported by this
fix to add the potential energy associated with this fix to the
system's potential energy as part of :doc:`thermodynamic output <thermo_style>`.

.. note::

   If you want the fictitious potential energy associated with the
   added forces to be included in the total potential energy of the
   system (the quantity being minimized), you MUST enable the
   :doc:`fix_modify <fix_modify>` *energy* option for this fix.

This fix computes a global scalar, which can be accessed by various
:ref:`output commands <howto_15>`.  The scalar is the
potential energy for all the restraints as discussed above. The scalar
value calculated by this fix is "extensive".

No parameter of this fix can be used with the *start/stop* keywords of
the :doc:`run <run>` command.
