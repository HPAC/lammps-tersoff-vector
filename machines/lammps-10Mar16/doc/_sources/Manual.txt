LAMMPS Documentation
====================

1 Mar 2016 version
------------------

Version info:
-------------

The LAMMPS "version" is the date when it was released, such as 1 May
2010. LAMMPS is updated continuously.  Whenever we fix a bug or add a
feature, we release it immediately, and post a notice on `this page of the WWW site <bug_>`_.  Each dated copy of LAMMPS contains all the
features and bug-fixes up to and including that version date. The
version date is printed to the screen and logfile every time you run
LAMMPS. It is also in the file src/version.h and in the LAMMPS
directory name created when you unpack a tarball, and at the top of
the first page of the manual (this page).

* If you browse the HTML doc pages on the LAMMPS WWW site, they always
  describe the most current version of LAMMPS.
* If you browse the HTML doc pages included in your tarball, they
  describe the version you have.
* The `PDF file <Manual.pdf>`_ on the WWW site or in the tarball is updated
  about once per month.  This is because it is large, and we don't want
  it to be part of every patch.
* There is also a `Developer.pdf <Developer.pdf>`_ file in the doc
  directory, which describes the internal structure and algorithms of
  LAMMPS.
LAMMPS stands for Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel
Simulator.

LAMMPS is a classical molecular dynamics simulation code designed to
run efficiently on parallel computers.  It was developed at Sandia
National Laboratories, a US Department of Energy facility, with
funding from the DOE.  It is an open-source code, distributed freely
under the terms of the GNU Public License (GPL).

The primary developers of LAMMPS are `Steve Plimpton <sjp_>`_, Aidan
Thompson, and Paul Crozier who can be contacted at
sjplimp,athomps,pscrozi at sandia.gov.  The `LAMMPS WWW Site <lws_>`_ at
http://lammps.sandia.gov has more information about the code and its
uses.

The LAMMPS documentation is organized into the following sections.  If
you find errors or omissions in this manual or have suggestions for
useful information to add, please send an email to the developers so
we can improve the LAMMPS documentation.

Once you are familiar with LAMMPS, you may want to bookmark :ref:`this page <comm>` at Section_commands.html#comm since
it gives quick access to documentation for all LAMMPS commands.
