Description
"""""""""""

Calculate the dynamical matrix from molecular dynamics simulations
based on fluctuation-dissipation theory for a group of atoms.

Consider a crystal with *N* unit cells in three dimensions labelled *l
= (l<sub>1</sub>,l<sub>2</sub>,l<sub>3</sub>)* where *l<sub>i</sub>*
are integers.  Each unit cell is defined by three linearly independent
vectors **a**<sub>1</sub>, **a**<sub>2</sub>, **a**<sub>3</sub> forming a
parallelipiped, containing *K* basis atoms labelled *k*.

Based on fluctuation-dissipation theory, the force constant
coefficients of the system in reciprocal space are given by
(:ref:`Campa&ntilde;&aacute; <Campana>` , :ref:`Kong <Kong>`)
<center><b>&Phi;</b><sub>k&alpha;,k'&beta;</sub>(<b>q</b>) =
k<sub>B</sub>T
<b>G</b><sup>-1</sup><sub>k&alpha;,k'&beta;</sub>(<b>q</b>),</center>

where **G** is the Green's functions coefficients given by

.. raw:: html

   <center><b>G</b><sub>k&alpha;,k'&beta;</sub>(<b>q</b>) =
   <<b>u</b><sub>k&alpha;</sub>(<b>q</b>)&#149;<b>u</b><sub>k'&beta;</sub><sup>*</sup>(<b>q</b>)>,</center>

where <...> denotes the ensemble average, and
<center>**u**<sub>k&alpha;</sub>(<b>q</b>) = &sum;<sub>l</sub>
<b>u</b><sub>lk&alpha;</sub> exp(i**qr**<sub>l</sub>)</center>

is the &alpha; component of the atomic displacement for the *k*th atom
in the unit cell in reciprocal space at **q**. In practice, the Green's
functions coefficients can also be measured according to the following
formula,

.. raw:: html

   <center><b>G</b><sub>k&alpha;,k'&beta;</sub>(<b>q</b>) =
   <<b>R</b><sub>k&alpha;</sub>(<b>q</b>)&#149;<b>R</b><sup>*</sup><sub>k'&beta;</sub>(<b>q</b>)>
   - <<b>R</b>><sub>k&alpha;</sub>(<b>q</b>)&#149;<<b>R</b>><sup>*</sup><sub>k'&beta;</sub>(<b>q</b>),
   </center>

where **R** is the instantaneous positions of atoms, and <**R**> is the
averaged atomic positions. It gives essentially the same results as
the displacement method and is easier to implement in an MD code.

Once the force constant matrix is known, the dynamical matrix **D** can
then be obtained by

.. raw:: html

   <center><b>D</b><sub>k&alpha;, k'&beta;</sub>(<b>q</b>) = (m<sub>k</sub>m<sub>k'</sub>)<sup>-1/2</sup> <b>&Phi;</b><sub>k&alpha;,k'&beta;</sub>(<b>q</b>)</center>

whose eigenvalues are exactly the phonon frequencies at **q**.

This fix uses positions of atoms in the specified group and calculates
two-point correlations.  To achieve this. the positions of the atoms
are examined every *Nevery* steps and are Fourier-transformed into
reciprocal space, where the averaging process and correlation
computation is then done.  After every *Noutput* measurements, the
matrix **G**(**q**) is calculated and inverted to obtain the elastic
stiffness coefficients.  The dynamical matrices are then constructed
and written to *prefix*.bin.timestep files in binary format and to the
file *prefix*.log for each wavevector **q**.

A detailed description of this method can be found in
(:ref:`Kong2011 <Kong2011>`).

The *sysdim* keyword is optional.  If specified with a value smaller
than the dimensionality of the LAMMPS simulation, its value is used
for the dynamical matrix calculation.  For example, using LAMMPS ot
model a 2D or 3D system, the phonon dispersion of a 1D atomic chain
can be computed using *sysdim* = 1.

The *nasr* keyword is optional.  An iterative procedure is employed to
enforce the acoustic sum rule on &Phi; at &Gamma;, and the number
provided by keyword *nasr* gives the total number of iterations. For a
system whose unit cell has only one atom, *nasr* = 1 is sufficient;
for other systems, *nasr* = 10 is typically sufficient.

The *map_file* contains the mapping information between the lattice
indices and the atom IDs, which tells the code which atom sits at
which lattice point; the lattice indices start from 0. An auxiliary
code, `latgen <http://code.google.com/p/latgen>`_, can be employed to
generate the compatible map file for various crystals.

In case one simulates an aperiodic system, where the whole simulation box
is treated as a unit cell, one can set *map_file* as *GAMMA*, so that the mapping
info will be generated internally and a file is not needed. In this case, the
dynamical matrix at only the gamma-point will/can be evaluated. Please keep in
mind that fix-phonon is designed for cyrstals, it will be inefficient and
even degrade the performance of lammps in case the unit cell is too large.

The calculated dynamical matrix elements are written out in
:doc:`energy/distance^2/mass <units>` units.  The coordinates for *q*
points in the log file is in the units of the basis vectors of the
corresponding reciprocal lattice.

Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

No information about this fix is written to :doc:`binary restart files <restart>`.

The :doc:`fix_modify <fix_modify>` *temp* option is supported by this
fix. You can use it to change the temperature compute from thermo_temp
to the one that reflects the true temperature of atoms in the group.

No global scalar or vector or per-atom quantities are stored by this
fix for access by various :ref:`output commands <4_15>`.

Instead, this fix outputs its initialization information (including
mapping information) and the calculated dynamical matrices to the file
*prefix*.log, with the specified *prefix*.  The dynamical matrices are
also written to files *prefix*.bin.timestep in binary format.  These
can be read by the post-processing tool in tools/phonon to compute the
phonon density of states and/or phonon dispersion curves.

No parameter of this fix can be used with the *start/stop* keywords
of the :doc:`run <run>` command.

This fix is not invoked during :doc:`energy minimization <minimize>`.

Restrictions
""""""""""""


This fix assumes a crystalline system with periodical lattice. The
temperature of the system should not exceed the melting temperature to
keep the system in its solid state.

This fix is part of the USER-PHONON package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the :ref:`Making LAMMPS <start_3>` section for more info.

This fix requires LAMMPS be built with an FFT library.  See the
:ref:`Making LAMMPS <start_2>` section for more info.

Default

The option defaults are sysdim = the same dimemsion as specified by
the `dimension <dimension>`_ command, and nasr = 20.
