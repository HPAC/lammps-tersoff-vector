Description
"""""""""""

The fix calculates a new stable time increment for use with the SMD time integrators.

The stable time increment is based on multiple conditions. For the SPH pair styles, a 
CFL criterion (Courant, Friedrichs & Lewy, 1928) is evaluated, which determines the the speed of
sound cannot propagate further than a typical spacing between particles within a single time step to ensure
no information is lost. For the contact pair styles, a linear analysis of the pair potential determines a
stable maximum time step.

This fix inquires the minimum stable time increment across all particles contained in the group for which this
fix is defined. An additional safety factor *s_fact* is applied to the time increment.

This fix is part of the USER-SMD package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package. See the :ref:`Making LAMMPS <start_3>`
section for more info.
