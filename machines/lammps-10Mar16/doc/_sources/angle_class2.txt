Description

The *class2* angle style uses the potential

where Ea is the angle term, Ebb is a bond-bond term, and Eba is a
bond-angle term.  Theta0 is the equilibrium angle and r1 and r2 are
the equilibrium bond lengths.

See :ref:`(Sun) <Sun>` for a description of the COMPASS class2 force field.

Coefficients for the Ea, Ebb, and Eba formulas must be defined for
each angle type via the :doc:`angle_coeff <angle_coeff>` command as in
the example above, or in the data file or restart files read by the
:doc:`read_data <read_data>` or :doc:`read_restart <read_restart>`
commands.

These are the 4 coefficients for the Ea formula:

* theta0 (degrees)
* K2 (energy/radian^2)
* K3 (energy/radian^3)
* K4 (energy/radian^4)

Theta0 is specified in degrees, but LAMMPS converts it to radians
internally; hence the units of the various K are in per-radian.

For the Ebb formula, each line in a :doc:`angle_coeff <angle_coeff>`
command in the input script lists 4 coefficients, the first of which
is "bb" to indicate they are BondBond coefficients.  In a data file,
these coefficients should be listed under a "BondBond Coeffs" heading
and you must leave out the "bb", i.e. only list 3 coefficients after
the angle type.

* bb
* M (energy/distance^2)
* r1 (distance)
* r2 (distance)

For the Eba formula, each line in a :doc:`angle_coeff <angle_coeff>`
command in the input script lists 5 coefficients, the first of which
is "ba" to indicate they are BondAngle coefficients.  In a data file,
these coefficients should be listed under a "BondAngle Coeffs" heading
and you must leave out the "ba", i.e. only list 4 coefficients after
the angle type.

* ba
* N1 (energy/distance^2)
* N2 (energy/distance^2)
* r1 (distance)
* r2 (distance)

The theta0 value in the Eba formula is not specified, since it is the
same value from the Ea formula.


----------


Styles with a *cuda*, *gpu*, *intel*, *kk*, *omp*, or *opt* suffix are
functionally the same as the corresponding style without the suffix.
They have been optimized to run faster, depending on your available
hardware, as discussed in :doc:`Section_accelerate <Section_accelerate>`
of the manual.  The accelerated styles take the same arguments and
should produce the same results, except for round-off and precision
issues.

These accelerated styles are part of the USER-CUDA, GPU, USER-INTEL,
KOKKOS, USER-OMP and OPT packages, respectively.  They are only
enabled if LAMMPS was built with those packages.  See the :ref:`Making LAMMPS <start_3>` section for more info.

You can specify the accelerated styles explicitly in your input script
by including their suffix, or you can use the :ref:`-suffix command-line switch <start_7>` when you invoke LAMMPS, or you can
use the :doc:`suffix <suffix>` command in your input script.

See :doc:`Section_accelerate <Section_accelerate>` of the manual for
more instructions on how to use the accelerated styles effectively.

Restrictions
""""""""""""


This angle style can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the CLASS2
package.  See the :ref:`Making LAMMPS <start_3>` section
for more info on packages.
