fix_modify command
==================

Syntax
""""""

.. parsed-literal::

   fix_modify fix-ID keyword value ...

* fix-ID = ID of the fix to modify
* one or more keyword/value pairs may be appended
* keyword = *temp* or *press* or *energy*
.. parsed-literal::

     *temp* value = compute ID that calculates a temperature
     *press* value = compute ID that calculates a pressure
     *energy* value = *yes* or *no*



Examples
""""""""

.. parsed-literal::

   fix_modify 3 temp myTemp press myPress
   fix_modify 1 energy yes

Description
"""""""""""

Modify one or more parameters of a previously defined fix.  Only
specific fix styles support specific parameters.  See the doc pages
for individual fix commands for info on which ones support which
fix_modify parameters.

The *temp* keyword is used to determine how a fix computes
temperature.  The specified compute ID must have been previously
defined by the user via the :doc:`compute <compute>` command and it must
be a style of compute that calculates a temperature.  All fixes that
compute temperatures define their own compute by default, as described
in their documentation.  Thus this option allows the user to override
the default method for computing T.

The *press* keyword is used to determine how a fix computes pressure.
The specified compute ID must have been previously defined by the user
via the :doc:`compute <compute>` command and it must be a style of
compute that calculates a pressure.  All fixes that compute pressures
define their own compute by default, as described in their
documentation.  Thus this option allows the user to override the
default method for computing P.

For fixes that calculate a contribution to the potential energy of the
system, the *energy* keyword will include that contribution in
thermodynamic output of potential energy.  See the
:doc:`thermo_style <thermo_style>` command for info on how potential
energy is output.  The contribution by itself can be printed by using
the keyword f_ID in the thermo_style custom command, where ID is the
fix-ID of the appropriate fix.  Note that you must use this setting
for a fix if you are using it when performing an :doc:`energy minimization <minimize>` and if you want the energy and forces it
produces to be part of the optimization criteria.

The option defaults are temp = ID defined by fix, press = ID defined
by fix, energy = no.
