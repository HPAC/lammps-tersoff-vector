.. index:: compute smd/vol

compute smd/vol command
=======================

Syntax
""""""

.. parsed-literal::

   compute ID group-ID smd/vol

* ID, group-ID are documented in :doc:`compute <compute>` command
* smd/vol = style name of this compute command

Examples
""""""""

.. parsed-literal::

   compute 1 all smd/vol

Description
"""""""""""

Define a computation that provides the per-particle volume and the sum
of the per-particle volumes of the group for which the fix is defined.

See `this PDF guide <USER/smd/SMD_LAMMPS_userguide.pdf>`_ to using Smooth
Mach Dynamics in LAMMPS.

**Output info:**

This compute calculates a per-particle vector, which can be accessed
by any command that uses per-particle values from a compute as input.
See :ref:`How-to discussions, section 6.15 <howto_15>` for
an overview of LAMMPS output options.

The per-particle vector values will be given in :doc:`units <units>` of
volume.

Additionally, the compute returns a scalar, which is the sum of the
per-particle volumes of the group for which the fix is defined.

Restrictions
""""""""""""


This compute is part of the USER-SMD package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package. See the :ref:`Making LAMMPS <start_3>` section for more info.
