compute ackland/atom command
============================

Syntax
""""""

.. parsed-literal::

   compute ID group-ID ackland/atom

* ID, group-ID are documented in :doc:`compute <compute>` command
* ackland/atom = style name of this compute command

Examples
""""""""

.. parsed-literal::

   compute 1 all ackland/atom

Description
"""""""""""

Defines a computation that calculates the local lattice structure
according to the formulation given in :ref:`(Ackland) <Ackland>`.

In contrast to the :doc:`centro-symmetry parameter <compute_centro_atom>` this method is stable against
temperature boost, because it is based not on the distance between
particles but the angles.  Therefore statistical fluctuations are
averaged out a little more.  A comparison with the Common Neighbor
Analysis metric is made in the paper.

The result is a number which is mapped to the following different
lattice structures:

* 0 = UNKNOWN
* 1 = BCC
* 2 = FCC
* 3 = HCP
* 4 = ICO

The neighbor list needed to compute this quantity is constructed each
time the calculation is performed (i.e. each time a snapshot of atoms
is dumped).  Thus it can be inefficient to compute/dump this quantity
too frequently or to have multiple compute/dump commands, each of
which computes this quantity.-

**Output info:**

This compute calculates a per-atom vector, which can be accessed by
any command that uses per-atom values from a compute as input.  See
:ref:`Section_howto 15 <howto_15>` for an overview of
LAMMPS output options.

Restrictions
""""""""""""


This compute is part of the USER-MISC package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the :ref:`Making LAMMPS <start_3>` section for more info.

The per-atom vector values will be unitless since they are the
integers defined above.
