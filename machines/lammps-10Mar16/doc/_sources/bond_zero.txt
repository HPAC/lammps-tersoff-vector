bond_style zero command
=======================

Syntax

   bond_style zero

Examples

.. parsed-literal::

   bond_style zero
   bond_coeff *

Description
"""""""""""

Using an bond style of zero means bond forces and energies are not
computed, but the geometry of bond pairs is still accessible to other
commands.

As an example, the :doc:`compute bond/local <compute_bond_local>`
command can be used to compute distances for the list of pairs of bond
atoms listed in the data file read by the :doc:`read_data <read_data>`
command.  If no bond style is defined, this command cannot be used.

Note that the :doc:`bond_coeff <bond_coeff>` command must be used for
all bond types, though no additional values are specified.

Restrictions
