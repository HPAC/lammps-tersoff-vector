Description
"""""""""""

Styles *brownian* and *brownain/poly* compute Brownian forces and
torques on finite-size spherical particles.  The former requires
monodisperse spherical particles; the latter allows for polydisperse
spherical particles.

These pair styles are designed to be used with either the :doc:`pair_style lubricate <pair_lubricate>` or :doc:`pair_style lubricateU <pair_lubricateU>` commands to provide thermostatting
when dissipative lubrication forces are acting.  Thus the parameters
*mu*, *flaglog*, *flagfld*, *cutinner*, and *cutoff* should be
specified consistent with the settings in the lubrication pair styles.
For details, refer to either of the lubrication pair styles.

The *t_target* setting is used to specify the target temperature of
the system.  The random number *seed* is used to generate random
numbers for the thermostatting procedure.

The *flagHI* and *flagVF* settings are optional.  Neither should be
used, or both must be defined.


----------


The following coefficients must be defined for each pair of atoms
types via the :doc:`pair_coeff <pair_coeff>` command as in the examples
above, or in the data file or restart files read by the
:doc:`read_data <read_data>` or :doc:`read_restart <read_restart>`
commands, or by mixing as described below:

* cutinner (distance units)
* cutoff (distance units)

The two coefficients are optional.  If neither is specified, the two
cutoffs specified in the pair_style command are used.  Otherwise both
must be specified.


----------


Styles with a *cuda*, *gpu*, *intel*, *kk*, *omp*, or *opt* suffix are
functionally the same as the corresponding style without the suffix.
They have been optimized to run faster, depending on your available
hardware, as discussed in :doc:`this section <Section_accelerate>` of
the manual.  The accelerated styles take the same arguments and should
produce the same results, except for round-off and precision issues.

These accelerated styles are part of the USER-CUDA, GPU, USER-INTEL,
KOKKOS, USER-OMP and OPT packages, respectively.  They are only
enabled if LAMMPS was built with those packages.  See the :ref:`Making LAMMPS <start_3>` section for more info.

You can specify the accelerated styles explicitly in your input script
by including their suffix, or you can use the :ref:`-suffix command-line switch <start_7>` when you invoke LAMMPS, or you can
use the :doc:`suffix <suffix>` command in your input script.

See :doc:`this section <Section_accelerate>` of the manual for more
instructions on how to use the accelerated styles effectively.


----------


**Mixing, shift, table, tail correction, restart, rRESPA info**:

For atom type pairs I,J and I != J, the two cutoff distances for this
pair style can be mixed.  The default mix value is *geometric*.  See
the "pair_modify" command for details.

This pair style does not support the :doc:`pair_modify <pair_modify>`
shift option for the energy of the pair interaction.

The :doc:`pair_modify <pair_modify>` table option is not relevant
for this pair style.

This pair style does not support the :doc:`pair_modify <pair_modify>`
tail option for adding long-range tail corrections to energy and
pressure.

This pair style writes its information to :doc:`binary restart files <restart>`, so pair_style and pair_coeff commands do not need
to be specified in an input script that reads a restart file.

This pair style can only be used via the *pair* keyword of the
:doc:`run_style respa <run_style>` command.  It does not support the
*inner*, *middle*, *outer* keywords.


----------


Restrictions
""""""""""""


These styles are part of the COLLOID package.  They are only enabled
if LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the :ref:`Making LAMMPS <2_3>` section for more info.

Only spherical monodisperse particles are allowed for pair_style
brownian.

Only spherical particles are allowed for pair_style brownian/poly.

Default
"""""""

The default settings for the optional args are flagHI = 1 and flagVF =
1.
