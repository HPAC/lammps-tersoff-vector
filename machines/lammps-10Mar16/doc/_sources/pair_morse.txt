Syntax

   pair_style morse cutoff

* cutoff = global cutoff for Morse interactions (distance units)

Examples

   pair_style morse 2.5

Description
"""""""""""

Style *morse* computes pairwise interactions with the formula

.. image:: Eqs/pair_morse.jpg
   :align: center

Rc is the cutoff.

The following coefficients must be defined for each pair of atoms
types via the :doc:`pair_coeff <pair_coeff>` command as in the examples
above, or in the data file or restart files read by the
:doc:`read_data <read_data>` or :doc:`read_restart <read_restart>`
commands:

* D0 (energy units)
* alpha (1/distance units)
* r0 (distance units)
* cutoff (distance units)

* The last coefficient is optional.  If not specified, the global morse
* cutoff is used.


----------


The *smooth/linear* variant is similar to the lj/smooth/linear variant
in that it adds to the potential a shift and a linear term to make both
the potential energy and force go to zero at the cut-off:

The syntax of the pair_style and pair_coeff commands are the same for
the *morse* and *morse/smooth/linear* styles.

same


----------


Styles with a *cuda*, *gpu*, *intel*, *kk*, *omp*, or *opt* suffix are
functionally the same as the corresponding style without the suffix.
They have been optimized to run faster, depending on your available
hardware, as discussed in :doc:`Section_accelerate <Section_accelerate>`
of the manual.  The accelerated styles take the same arguments and
should produce the same results, except for round-off and precision
issues.

These accelerated styles are part of the USER-CUDA, GPU, USER-INTEL,
KOKKOS, USER-OMP and OPT packages, respectively.  They are only
enabled if LAMMPS was built with those packages.  See the :ref:`Making LAMMPS <start_3>` section for more info.

You can specify the accelerated styles explicitly in your input script
by including their suffix, or you can use the :ref:`-suffix command-line switch <start_7>` when you invoke LAMMPS, or you can
use the :doc:`suffix <suffix>` command in your input script.

See :doc:`Section_accelerate <Section_accelerate>` of the manual for
more instructions on how to use the accelerated styles effectively.


----------


**Mixing, shift, table, tail correction, restart, rRESPA info**:

None of these pair styles support mixing.  Thus, coefficients for all
I,J pairs must be specified explicitly.

All of these pair styles support the :doc:`pair_modify <pair_modify>`
shift option for the energy of the pair interaction.

The :doc:`pair_modify <pair_modify>` table options is not relevant for
the Morse pair styles.

None of these pair styles support the :doc:`pair_modify <pair_modify>`
tail option for adding long-range tail corrections to energy and
pressure.

All of these pair styles write their information to :doc:`binary restart files <restart>`, so pair_style and pair_coeff commands do not need
to be specified in an input script that reads a restart file.

These pair styles can only be used via the *pair* keyword of the
:doc:`run_style respa <run_style>` command.  They do not support the
*inner*, *middle*, *outer* keywords.

Restrictions
""""""""""""


The *morse/smooth/linear* pair style is only enabled if LAMMPS was
built with the USER-MISC package.  See the :ref:`Making LAMMPS <start_3>` section for more info.
