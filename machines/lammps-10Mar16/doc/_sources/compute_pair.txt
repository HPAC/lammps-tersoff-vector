compute pair command
====================

Syntax
""""""

.. parsed-literal::

   compute ID group-ID pair pstyle evalue

* ID, group-ID are documented in :doc:`compute <compute>` command
* pair = style name of this compute command
* pstyle = style name of a pair style that calculates additional values
* evalue = *epair* or *evdwl* or *ecoul* or blank (optional setting)

Examples

.. parsed-literal::

   compute 1 all pair gauss
   compute 1 all pair lj/cut/coul/cut ecoul
   compute 1 all pair reax

Description
"""""""""""

Define a computation that extracts additional values calculated by a
pair style, sums them across processors, and makes them accessible for
output or further processing by other commands.  The group specified
for this command is ignored.

The specified *pstyle* must be a pair style used in your simulation
either by itself or as a sub-style in a :doc:`pair_style hybrid or hybrid/overlay <pair_hybrid>` command.

The *evalue* setting is optional; it may be left off the command.  All
pair styles tally a potential energy *epair* which may be broken into
two parts: *evdwl* and *ecoul* such that *epair* = *evdwl* + *ecoul*.
If the pair style calculates Coulombic interactions, their energy will
be tallied in *ecoul*.  Everything else (whether it is a Lennard-Jones
style van der Waals interaction or not) is tallied in *evdwl*.  If
*evalue* is specified as *epair* or left out, then *epair* is stored
as a global scalar by this compute.  This is useful when using
:doc:`pair_style hybrid <pair_hybrid>` if you want to know the portion
of the total energy contributed by one sub-style.  If *evalue* is
specfied as *evdwl* or *ecoul*, then just that portion of the energy
is stored as a global scalar.

.. note::

   The energy returned by the *evdwl* keyword does not include tail
   corrections, even if they are enabled via the
   :doc:`pair_modify <pair_modify>` command.

Some pair styles tally additional quantities, e.g. a breakdown of
potential energy into a dozen or so components is tallied by the
:doc:`pair_style reax <pair_reax>` commmand.  These values (1 or more)
are stored as a global vector by this compute.  See the doc page for
:doc:`individual pair styles <pair_style>` for info on these values.

**Output info:**

This compute calculates a global scalar which is *epair* or *evdwl* or
*ecoul*.  If the pair style supports it, it also calculates a global
vector of length >= 1, as determined by the pair style.  These values
can be used by any command that uses global scalar or vector values
from a compute as input.  See :ref:`this section <howto_15>` for an overview of LAMMPS output
options.

The scalar and vector values calculated by this compute are
"extensive".

The scalar value will be in energy :doc:`units <units>`.  The vector
values will typically also be in energy :doc:`units <units>`, but
see the doc page for the pair style for details.
