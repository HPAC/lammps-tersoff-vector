Description

The *fene* bond style uses the potential

   :align: center

to define a finite extensible nonlinear elastic (FENE) potential
:ref:`(Kremer) <Kremer>`, used for bead-spring polymer models.  The first
term is attractive, the 2nd Lennard-Jones term is repulsive.  The
first term extends to R0, the maximum extent of the bond.  The 2nd
term is cutoff at 2^(1/6) sigma, the minimum of the LJ potential.

The following coefficients must be defined for each bond type via the
:doc:`bond_coeff <bond_coeff>` command as in the example above, or in
the data file or restart files read by the :doc:`read_data <read_data>`
or :doc:`read_restart <read_restart>` commands:

* K (energy/distance^2)
* R0 (distance)
* epsilon (energy)
* sigma (distance)


----------


Styles with a *cuda*, *gpu*, *intel*, *kk*, *omp*, or *opt* suffix are
functionally the same as the corresponding style without the suffix.
They have been optimized to run faster, depending on your available
hardware, as discussed in :doc:`Section_accelerate <Section_accelerate>`
of the manual.  The accelerated styles take the same arguments and
should produce the same results, except for round-off and precision
issues.

These accelerated styles are part of the USER-CUDA, GPU, USER-INTEL,
KOKKOS, USER-OMP and OPT packages, respectively.  They are only
enabled if LAMMPS was built with those packages.  See the :ref:`Making LAMMPS <start_3>` section for more info.

You can specify the accelerated styles explicitly in your input script
by including their suffix, or you can use the :ref:`-suffix command-line switch <start_7>` when you invoke LAMMPS, or you can
use the :doc:`suffix <suffix>` command in your input script.

See :doc:`Section_accelerate <Section_accelerate>` of the manual for
more instructions on how to use the accelerated styles effectively.

Restrictions
""""""""""""


This bond style can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the
MOLECULE package (which it is by default).  See the :ref:`Making LAMMPS <start_3>` section for more info on packages.

You typically should specify `special_bonds fene <special_bonds.html">`_
or :doc:`special_bonds lj/coul 0 1 1 <special_bonds>` to use this bond
style.  LAMMPS will issue a warning it that's not the case.
