.. index:: compute smd/damage

compute smd/damage command
==========================

Syntax
""""""

.. parsed-literal::

   compute ID group-ID smd/damage

* ID, group-ID are documented in :doc:`compute <compute>` command
* smd/damage = style name of this compute command

Examples
""""""""

.. parsed-literal::

   compute 1 all smd/damage

Description
"""""""""""

Define a computation that calculates the damage status of SPH particles
according to the damage model which is defined via the SMD SPH pair styles, e.g., the maximum plastic strain failure criterion.

See `this PDF guide <USER/smd/SMD_LAMMPS_userguide.pdf>`_ to use Smooth Mach Dynamics in LAMMPS.

**Output Info:**

This compute calculates a per-particle vector, which can be accessed by
any command that uses per-particle values from a compute as input.  See
:ref:`How-to discussions, section 6.15 <howto_15>`
for an overview of LAMMPS output options.

The per-particle values are dimensionless an in the range of zero to one.

Restrictions
""""""""""""


This compute is part of the USER-SMD package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the :ref:`Making LAMMPS <start_3>`
section for more info.
