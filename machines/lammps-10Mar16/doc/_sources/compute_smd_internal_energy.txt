compute smd/internal/energy command
===================================

Syntax
""""""

.. parsed-literal::

   compute ID group-ID smd/internal/energy

* ID, group-ID are documented in :doc:`compute <compute>` command
* smd/smd/internal/energy = style name of this compute command

Examples
""""""""

.. parsed-literal::

   compute 1 all smd/internal/energy

Description
"""""""""""

Define a computation which outputs the per-particle enthalpy, i.e.,
the sum of potential energy and heat.

See `this PDF guide <USER/smd/SMD_LAMMPS_userguide.pdf>`_ to use Smooth
Mach Dynamics in LAMMPS.

**Output Info:**

This compute calculates a per-particle vector, which can be accessed
by any command that uses per-particle values from a compute as input.
See :ref:`How-to discussions, section 6.15 <howto_15>` for
an overview of LAMMPS output options.

The per-particle vector values will be given in :doc:`units <units>` of energy.

Restrictions
""""""""""""


This compute is part of the USER-SMD package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the :ref:`Making LAMMPS <start_3>` section for more info. This compute
can only be used for particles which interact via the updated
Lagrangian or total Lagrangian SPH pair styles.
