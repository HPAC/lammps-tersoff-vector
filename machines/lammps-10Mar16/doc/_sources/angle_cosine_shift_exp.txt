The *cosine/shift/exp* angle style uses the potential

   :align: center

where Umin, theta, and a are defined for each angle type.

The potential is bounded between [-Umin:0] and the minimum is
located at the angle theta0. The a parameter can be both positive or
negative and is used to control the spring constant at the
equilibrium.

The spring constant is given by k = A exp(A) Umin / [2 (Exp(a)-1)].
For a > 3, k/Umin = a/2 to better than 5% relative error. For negative
values of the a parameter, the spring constant is essentially zero,
and anharmonic terms takes over. The potential is furthermore well
behaved in the limit a -> 0, where it has been implemented to linear
order in a for a < 0.001. In this limit the potential reduces to the
cosineshifted potential.

The following coefficients must be defined for each angle type via the
:doc:`angle_coeff <angle_coeff>` command as in the example above, or in
the data file or restart files read by the :doc:`read_data <read_data>`
or :doc:`read_restart <read_restart>` commands:

* umin (energy)
* theta (angle)
* A (real number)


----------


Styles with a *cuda*, *gpu*, *intel*, *kk*, *omp*, or *opt* suffix are
functionally the same as the corresponding style without the suffix.
They have been optimized to run faster, depending on your available
hardware, as discussed in :doc:`Section_accelerate <Section_accelerate>`
of the manual.  The accelerated styles take the same arguments and
should produce the same results, except for round-off and precision
issues.

These accelerated styles are part of the USER-CUDA, GPU, USER-INTEL,
KOKKOS, USER-OMP and OPT packages, respectively.  They are only
enabled if LAMMPS was built with those packages.  See the :ref:`Making LAMMPS <start_3>` section for more info.

You can specify the accelerated styles explicitly in your input script
by including their suffix, or you can use the :ref:`-suffix command-line switch <start_7>` when you invoke LAMMPS, or you can
use the :doc:`suffix <suffix>` command in your input script.

See :doc:`Section_accelerate <Section_accelerate>` of the manual for
more instructions on how to use the accelerated styles effectively.
