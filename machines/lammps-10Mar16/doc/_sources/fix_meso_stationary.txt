Description
"""""""""""

Perform time integration to update internal energy and local density,
but not position or velocity for atoms in the group each timestep.
This fix is needed for SPH simulations to correctly time-integrate
fixed boundary particles which constrain a fluid to a given region in
space.

See `this PDF guide <USER/sph/SPH_LAMMPS_userguide.pdf>`_ to using SPH in
LAMMPS.

by this fix for access by various :ref:`output commands <howto_15>`.  No parameter of this fix can
be used with the *start/stop* keywords of the :doc:`run <run>` command.
This fix is not invoked during :doc:`energy minimization <minimize>`.

Restrictions
