The *helix* dihedral style uses the potential

.. image:: Eqs/dihedral_helix.jpg
   :align: center

This coarse-grain dihedral potential is described in :ref:`(Guo) <Guo>`.
For dihedral angles in the helical region, the energy function is
represented by a standard potential consisting of three minima, one
corresponding to the trans (t) state and the other to gauche states
(g+ and g-).  The paper describes how the A,B,C parameters are chosen
so as to balance secondary (largely driven by local interactions) and
tertiary structure (driven by long-range interactions).

The following coefficients must be defined for each dihedral type via the
:doc:`dihedral_coeff <dihedral_coeff>` command as in the example above, or in
the data file or restart files read by the :doc:`read_data <read_data>`
or :doc:`read_restart <read_restart>` commands:

* A (energy)
* B (energy)
* C (energy)


----------


Styles with a *cuda*, *gpu*, *intel*, *kk*, *omp*, or *opt* suffix are
functionally the same as the corresponding style without the suffix.
They have been optimized to run faster, depending on your available
hardware, as discussed in :doc:`Section_accelerate <Section_accelerate>`
of the manual.  The accelerated styles take the same arguments and
should produce the same results, except for round-off and precision
issues.

These accelerated styles are part of the USER-CUDA, GPU, USER-INTEL,
KOKKOS, USER-OMP and OPT packages, respectively.  They are only
enabled if LAMMPS was built with those packages.  See the :ref:`Making LAMMPS <start_3>` section for more info.

You can specify the accelerated styles explicitly in your input script
by including their suffix, or you can use the :ref:`-suffix command-line switch <start_7>` when you invoke LAMMPS, or you can
use the :doc:`suffix <suffix>` command in your input script.

See :doc:`Section_accelerate <Section_accelerate>` of the manual for
more instructions on how to use the accelerated styles effectively.

Restrictions
""""""""""""


This dihedral style can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the
MOLECULE package (which it is by default).  See the :ref:`Making LAMMPS <start_3>` section for more info on packages.
