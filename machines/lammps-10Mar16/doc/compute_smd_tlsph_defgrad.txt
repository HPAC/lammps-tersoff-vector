compute smd/tlsph/defgrad command :h3

[Syntax:]

compute ID group-ID smd/tlsph/defgrad :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "compute"_compute.html command
smd/tlsph/defgrad = style name of this compute command :ul

[Examples:]

compute 1 all smd/tlsph/defgrad :pre

[Description:]

Define a computation that calculates the deformation gradient.  It is
only meaningful for particles which interact according to the
Total-Lagrangian SPH pair style.

See "this PDF guide"_USER/smd/SMD_LAMMPS_userguide.pdf to use Smooth
Mach Dynamics in LAMMPS.

[Output info:]

This compute outputss a per-particle vector of vectors (tensors),
which can be accessed by any command that uses per-particle values
from a compute as input. See "How-to discussions, section
6.15"_Section_howto.html#howto_15 for an overview of LAMMPS output
options.

The per-particle vector values will be given dimensionless. See
"units"_units.html.  The per-particle vector has 10 entries. The first
nine entries correspond to the xx, xy, xz, yx, yy, yz, zx, zy, zz
components of the asymmetric deformation gradient tensor. The tenth
entry is the determinant of the deformation gradient.

[Restrictions:]

This compute is part of the USER-SMD package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package. See the "Making
LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#start_3 section for more info. TThis
compute can only be used for particles which interact via the total
Lagrangian SPH pair style.
