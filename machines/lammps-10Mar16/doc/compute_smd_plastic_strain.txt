compute smd/plastic/strain command :h3

[Syntax:]

compute ID group-ID smd/plastic/strain :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "compute"_compute.html command
smd/plastic/strain = style name of this compute command :ul

[Examples:]

compute 1 all smd/plastic/strain :pre

[Description:]

Define a computation that outputs the equivalent plastic strain per
particle.  This command is only meaningful if a material model with
plasticity is defined.

See "this PDF guide"_USER/smd/SMD_LAMMPS_userguide.pdf to use Smooth
Mach Dynamics in LAMMPS.

[Output Info:]

This compute calculates a per-particle vector, which can be accessed
by any command that uses per-particle values from a compute as input.
See "How-to discussions, section 6.15"_Section_howto.html#howto_15 for
an overview of LAMMPS output options.

The per-particle values will be given dimensionless. See "units"_units.html.

[Restrictions:]

This compute is part of the USER-SMD package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the "Making
LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#start_3 section for more info. This compute
can only be used for particles which interact via the updated
Lagrangian or total Lagrangian SPH pair styles.
