<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p>LAMMPS is designed in a modular fashion so as to be easy to modify and
extend with new functionality.  In fact, about 75% of its source code
is files added in this fashion.</p>
<p>In this section, changes and additions users can make are listed along
with minimal instructions.  If you add a new feature to LAMMPS and
think it will be of interest to general users, we encourage you to
submit it to the developers for inclusion in the released version of
LAMMPS.  Information about how to do this is provided
<a class="reference internal" href="#mod-14"><span>below</span></a>.</p>
<p>The best way to add a new feature is to find a similar feature in
LAMMPS and look at the corresponding source and header files to figure
out what it does.  You will need some knowledge of C++ to be able to
understand the hi-level structure of LAMMPS and its class
organization, but functions (class methods) that do actual
computations are written in vanilla C-style code and operate on simple
C-style data structures (vectors and arrays).</p>
<p>Most of the new features described in this section require you to
write a new C++ derived class (except for exceptions described below,
where you can make small edits to existing files).  Creating a new
class requires 2 files, a source code file (<em>.cpp) and a header file
(</em>.h).  The derived class must provide certain methods to work as a
new option.  Depending on how different your new feature is compared
to existing features, you can either derive from the base class
itself, or from a derived class that already exists.  Enabling LAMMPS
to invoke the new class is as simple as putting the two source
files in the src dir and re-building LAMMPS.</p>
<p>The advantage of C++ and its object-orientation is that all the code
and variables needed to define the new feature are in the 2 files you
write, and thus shouldn&#8217;t make the rest of LAMMPS more complex or
cause side-effect bugs.</p>
<p>Here is a concrete example.  Suppose you write 2 files pair_foo.cpp
and pair_foo.h that define a new class PairFoo that computes pairwise
potentials described in the classic 1997 <a class="reference internal" href="#foo"><span>paper</span></a> by Foo, et al.
If you wish to invoke those potentials in a LAMMPS input script with a
command like</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>pair_style foo 0.1 3.5
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>then your pair_foo.h file should be structured as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>#ifdef PAIR_CLASS
PairStyle(foo,PairFoo)
#else
...
(class definition for PairFoo)
...
#endif
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>where &#8220;foo&#8221; is the style keyword in the pair_style command, and
PairFoo is the class name defined in your pair_foo.cpp and pair_foo.h
files.</p>
<p>When you re-build LAMMPS, your new pairwise potential becomes part of
the executable and can be invoked with a pair_style command like the
example above.  Arguments like 0.1 and 3.5 can be defined and
processed by your new class.</p>
<p>As illustrated by this pairwise example, many kinds of options are
referred to in the LAMMPS documentation as the &#8220;style&#8221; of a particular
command.</p>
<p>The instructions below give the header file for the base class that
these styles are derived from.  Public variables in that file are ones
used and set by the derived classes which are also used by the base
class.  Sometimes they are also used by the rest of LAMMPS.  Virtual
functions in the base class header file which are set = 0 are ones you
must define in your new derived class to give it the functionality
LAMMPS expects.  Virtual functions that are not set to 0 are functions
you can optionally define.</p>
<p>Additionally, new output options can be added directly to the
thermo.cpp, dump_custom.cpp, and variable.cpp files as explained
below.</p>
<p>Here are additional guidelines for modifying LAMMPS and adding new
functionality:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Think about whether what you want to do would be better as a pre- or
post-processing step.  Many computations are more easily and more
quickly done that way.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t do anything within the timestepping of a run that isn&#8217;t
parallel.  E.g. don&#8217;t accumulate a bunch of data on a single processor
and analyze it.  You run the risk of seriously degrading the parallel
efficiency.</li>
<li>If your new feature reads arguments or writes output, make sure you
follow the unit conventions discussed by the <a class="reference internal" href="units.html"><em>units</em></a>
command.</li>
<li>If you add something you think is truly useful and doesn&#8217;t impact
LAMMPS performance when it isn&#8217;t used, send an email to the
<a class="reference external" href="http://lammps.sandia.gov/authors.html">developers</a>.  We might be
interested in adding it to the LAMMPS distribution.  See further
details on this at the bottom of this page.</li>

<p>The constructor of the derived class sets values for several variables
that you must set when defining a new atom style, which are documented
in atom_vec.h.  New atom arrays are defined in atom.cpp.  Search for
the word &#8220;customize&#8221; and you will find locations you will need to
modify.</p>

<p class="last">It is possible to add some attributes, such as a molecule ID, to
atom styles that do not have them via the <a class="reference internal" href="fix_property_atom.html"><em>fix property/atom</em></a> command.  This command also
allows new custom attributes consisting of extra integer or
floating-point values to be added to atoms.  See the <a class="reference internal" href="fix_property_atom.html"><em>fix property/atom</em></a> doc page for examples of cases

The code for these classes can use the per-atom properties defined by
fix property/atom.  The Atom class has a find_custom() method that is
useful in this context:</p>

<p>The &#8220;name&#8221; of a custom attribute, as specified in the <a class="reference internal" href="fix_property_atom.html"><em>fix property/atom</em></a> command, is checked to verify
that it exists and its index is returned.  The method also sets flag =
0/1 depending on whether it is an integer or floating-point attribute.
The vector of values associated with the attribute can then be
accessed using the returned index as</p>

and then called from the Pair::ev_tally() function, which is called for
each pair after force and energy has been computed for this pair. Then
the tallied values are retrieved with the standard compute_scalar or
compute_vector or compute_peratom methods. The USER-TALLY package
provides <a href="#id7"><span class="problematic" id="id8">*</span></a>examples*_compute_tally.html for utilizing this mechanism.</p>

<p>In LAMMPS, a &#8220;fix&#8221; is any operation that is computed during
timestepping that alters some property of the system.  Essentially
everything that happens during a simulation besides force computation,
neighbor list construction, and output, is a &#8220;fix&#8221;.  This includes
time integration (update of coordinates and velocities), force
constraints or boundary conditions (SHAKE or walls), and diagnostics
(compute a diffusion coefficient).  New styles can be created to add
new options to LAMMPS.</p>
<p>Fix_setforce.cpp is a simple example of setting forces on atoms to
prescribed values.  There are dozens of fix options already in LAMMPS;
choose one as a template that is similar to what you want to
implement.</p>

<p>Typically, only a small fraction of these methods are defined for a
particular fix.  Setmask is mandatory, as it determines when the fix
will be invoked during the timestep.  Fixes that perform time
integration (<em>nve</em>, <em>nvt</em>, <em>npt</em>) implement initial_integrate() and
final_integrate() to perform velocity Verlet updates.  Fixes that
constrain forces implement post_force().</p>
<p>Fixes that perform diagnostics typically implement end_of_step().  For
an end_of_step fix, one of your fix arguments must be the variable
&#8220;nevery&#8221; which is used to determine when to call the fix and you must
set this variable in the constructor of your fix.  By convention, this
is the first argument the fix defines (after the ID, group-ID, style).</p>
<p>If the fix needs to store information for each atom that persists from
timestep to timestep, it can manage that memory and migrate the info
with the atoms as they move from processors to processor by
implementing the grow_arrays, copy_arrays, pack_exchange, and
unpack_exchange methods.  Similarly, the pack_restart and
unpack_restart methods can be implemented to store information about
the fix in restart files.  If you wish an integrator or force
constraint fix to work with rRESPA (see the <a class="reference internal" href="run_style.html"><em>run_style</em></a>
command), the initial_integrate, post_force_integrate, and
final_integrate_respa methods can be implemented.  The thermo method
enables a fix to contribute values to thermodynamic output, as printed
quantities and/or to be summed to the potential energy of the system.</p>

<a class="reference external" href="http://lammps.sandia.gov/authors.html">developers</a> with info about
your package and we will post it there.</p>
</div>
<p>The previous sections of this doc page describe how to add new &#8220;style&#8221;
files of various kinds to LAMMPS.  Packages are simply collections of
one or more new class files which are invoked as a new style within a
LAMMPS input script.  If designed correctly, these additions typically
do not require changes to the main core of LAMMPS; they are simply
add-on files.  If you think your new feature requires non-trivial
changes in core LAMMPS files, you&#8217;ll need to <a class="reference external" href="http://lammps.sandia.gov/authors.html">communicate with the developers</a>, since we may or may
not want to make those changes.  An example of a trivial change is
making a parent-class method &#8220;virtual&#8221; when you derive a new child
class from it.</p>
<p>Here are the steps you need to follow to submit a single file or user
package for our consideration.  Following these steps will save both
you and us time.  See existing files in packages in the src dir for
examples.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>All source files you provide must compile with the most current
version of LAMMPS.</li>
<li>If you want your file(s) to be added to main LAMMPS or one of its
standard packages, then it needs to be written in a style compatible
with other LAMMPS source files.  This is so the developers can
understand it and hopefully maintain it.  This basically means that
the code accesses data structures, performs its operations, and is
formatted similar to other LAMMPS source files, including the use of
the error class for error and warning messages.</li>
<li>If you want your contribution to be added as a user-contributed
feature, and it&#8217;s a single file (actually a <a href="#id10"><span class="problematic" id="id11">*</span></a>.cpp and <a href="#id12"><span class="problematic" id="id13">*</span></a>.h file) it can
rapidly be added to the USER-MISC directory.  Send us the one-line
entry to add to the USER-MISC/README file in that dir, along with the
2 source files.  You can do this multiple times if you wish to
contribute several individual features.</li>
<li>If you want your contribution to be added as a user-contribution and
it is several related featues, it is probably best to make it a user
package directory with a name like USER-FOO.  In addition to your new
files, the directory should contain a README text file.  The README
should contain your name and contact information and a brief
description of what your new package does.  If your files depend on
other LAMMPS style files also being installed (e.g. because your file
is a derived class from the other LAMMPS class), then an Install.sh
file is also needed to check for those dependencies.  See other README
and Install.sh files in other USER directories as examples.  Send us a
tarball of this USER-FOO directory.</li>
<li>Your new source files need to have the LAMMPS copyright, GPL notice,
and your name and email address at the top, like other
user-contributed LAMMPS source files.  They need to create a class
that is inside the LAMMPS namespace.  If the file is for one of the
USER packages, including USER-MISC, then we are not as picky about the
coding style (see above).  I.e. the files do not need to be in the
same stylistic format and syntax as other LAMMPS files, though that
would be nice for developers as well as users who try to read your
code.</li>
<li>You must also create a documentation file for each new command or
style you are adding to LAMMPS.  This will be one file for a
single-file feature.  For a package, it might be several files.  These
are simple text files which we auto-convert to HTML.  Thus they must
be in the same format as other <em>.txt files in the lammps/doc directory
for similar commands and styles; use one or more of them as a starting
point.  As appropriate, the text files can include links to equations
(see doc/Eqs/</em>.tex for examples, we auto-create the associated JPG
files), or figures (see doc/JPG for examples), or even additional PDF
files with further details (see doc/PDF for examples).  The doc page
should also include literature citations as appropriate; see the
bottom of doc/fix_nh.txt for examples and the earlier part of the same
file for how to format the cite itself.  The &#8220;Restrictions&#8221; section of
the doc page should indicate that your command is only available if
LAMMPS is built with the appropriate USER-MISC or USER-FOO package.
See other user package doc files for examples of how to do this.  The
txt2html tool we use to convert to HTML can be downloaded from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sandia.gov/~sjplimp/download.html">this site</a>, so you can perform
the HTML conversion yourself to proofread your doc page.</li>
<li>For a new package (or even a single command) you can include one or
more example scripts.  These should run in no more than 1 minute, even
on a single processor, and not require large data files as input.  See
directories under examples/USER for examples of input scripts other
users provided for their packages.</li>
<li>If there is a paper of yours describing your feature (either the
algorithm/science behind the feature itself, or its initial usage, or
its implementation in LAMMPS), you can add the citation to the <a href="#id14"><span class="problematic" id="id15">*</span></a>.cpp
source file.  See src/USER-EFF/atom_vec_electron.cpp for an example.
A LaTeX citation is stored in a variable at the top of the file and a
single line of code that references the variable is added to the
constructor of the class.  Whenever a user invokes your feature from
their input script, this will cause LAMMPS to output the citation to a
log.cite file and prompt the user to examine the file.  Note that you
should only use this for a paper you or your group authored.
E.g. adding a cite in the code for a paper by Nose and Hoover if you
write a fix that implements their integrator is not the intended
usage.  That kind of citation should just be in the doc page you
provide.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, as a general rule-of-thumb, the more clear and
self-explanatory you make your doc and README files, and the easier
you make it for people to get started, e.g. by providing example
scripts, the more likely it is that users will try out your new
feature.</p>
