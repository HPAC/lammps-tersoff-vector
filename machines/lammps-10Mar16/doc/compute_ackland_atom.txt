compute ackland/atom command :h3

[Syntax:]

compute ID group-ID ackland/atom :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "compute"_compute.html command
ackland/atom = style name of this compute command :ul

[Examples:]

compute 1 all ackland/atom :pre

[Description:]

Defines a computation that calculates the local lattice structure
according to the formulation given in "(Ackland)"_#Ackland.

In contrast to the "centro-symmetry
parameter"_compute_centro_atom.html this method is stable against
temperature boost, because it is based not on the distance between
particles but the angles.  Therefore statistical fluctuations are
averaged out a little more.  A comparison with the Common Neighbor
Analysis metric is made in the paper.

The result is a number which is mapped to the following different
lattice structures:

0 = UNKNOWN
1 = BCC
2 = FCC
3 = HCP
4 = ICO :ul

The neighbor list needed to compute this quantity is constructed each
time the calculation is performed (i.e. each time a snapshot of atoms
is dumped).  Thus it can be inefficient to compute/dump this quantity
too frequently or to have multiple compute/dump commands, each of
which computes this quantity.-

[Output info:]

This compute calculates a per-atom vector, which can be accessed by
any command that uses per-atom values from a compute as input.  See
"Section_howto 15"_Section_howto.html#howto_15 for an overview of
LAMMPS output options.

[Restrictions:]

This compute is part of the USER-MISC package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the "Making
LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#start_3 section for more info.

The per-atom vector values will be unitless since they are the
integers defined above.
