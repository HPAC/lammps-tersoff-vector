Example simulations of polarizable systems using Drude oscillators
==================================================================

Each example comes in two versions for demonstrating the use of
Nos√©-Hoover or Langevin thermostats.

* `butane` -- simulation in NVT ensemble with Thole damping

* `ethanol` -- simulation in NpT ensemble with Thole damping

* `swm4-ndp` -- 4-site rigid water model in NpT ensemble (no Thole 
damping)
