This directory contains input files for DPD simulations under
isothermal, isoenergetic, isobaric and isoenthalpic conditions.  All
the DPD scenarios use the Shardlow splitting algorithm to integrate
the equations of motion.  The compute dpd command is used in the
isoenergetic and isenthalpic case to demonstrate how one can access
the particle internal energies.
