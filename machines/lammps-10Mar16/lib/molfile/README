This directory has a Makefile.lammps file with settings that allows
LAMMPS to dynamically link to the VMD molfile library.  This is
required to use the USER-MOLFILE package and its interface to the dump
and write_dump commands in a LAMMPS input script.

More information about the VMD molfile plugins can be found at
http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/plugins/molfile.

More specifically, to be able to dynamically load and execute the
plugins from inside LAMMPS, you need to link with a system library
containing functions like dlopen(), dlsym() and so on for dynamic
linking of executable code into an executable.  This library is
defined by setting the molfile_SYSLIB variable in the Makefile.lammps
file in this dir.

For Linux and most current unix-like operating systems, this can be
kept at the default setting of "-ldl" (on some platforms this library
is called "-ldld").  For compilation on Windows, a slightly different
mechanism is used that is part of the Windows programming environment
and this library is not needed.

See the header of Makefile.lammps for more info.
