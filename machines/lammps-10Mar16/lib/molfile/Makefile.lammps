# This file contains the hooks to build and link LAMMPS with the VMD
# molfile plugins described here:
# 
# http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/plugins/molfile
# 
# When you build LAMMPS with the USER-MOLFILE package installed, it will
# use the 3 settings in this file.  They should be set as follows.
# 
# The molfile_SYSLIB setting is for a system dynamic loading library
# that will be used to load the molfile plugins.  It contains functions
# like dlopen(), dlsym() and so on for dynamic linking of executable
# code into an executable.  For Linux and most current Unix-like
# operating systems, the setting of "-ldl" will work.  On some platforms
# you may need "-ldld".  For compilation on Windows, a different
# mechanism is used that is part of the Windows programming environment
# and thus molfile_SYSLIB can be left blank.
# 
# The molfile_SYSINC and molfile_SYSPATH variables do not typically need
# to be set.  If the dl library is not in a place the linker can find
# it, specify its directory via the molfile_SYSPATH variable, e.g.
# -Ldir.
