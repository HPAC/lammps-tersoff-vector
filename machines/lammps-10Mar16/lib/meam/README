MEAM (modified embedded atom method) library

This library is in implementation of the MEAM potential, specifically
designed to work with LAMMPS.

-------------------------------------------------

This directory has source files to build a library that LAMMPS
links against when using the MEAM package.

This library must be built with a F90 compiler, before LAMMPS is
built, so LAMMPS can link against it.

Build the library using one of the provided Makefile.* files or create
your own, specific to your compiler and system.  For example:

make -f Makefile.gfortran

When you are done building this library, two files should
exist in this directory:

libmeam.a		the library LAMMPS will link against
Makefile.lammps		settings the LAMMPS Makefile will import

Makefile.lammps is created by the make command, by copying one of the
Makefile.lammps.* files.  See the EXTRAMAKE setting at the top of the
Makefile.* files.

IMPORTANT: You must examine the final Makefile.lammps to insure it is
correct for your system, else the LAMMPS build will likely fail.

Makefile.lammps has settings for 3 variables:

user-meam_SYSINC = leave blank for this package
user-meam_SYSLIB = auxiliary F90 libs needed to link a F90 lib with
                  a C++ program (LAMMPS) via a C++ compiler
user-meam_SYSPATH = path(s) to where those libraries are

Because you have a F90 compiler on your system, you should have these
libraries.  But you will have to figure out which ones are needed and
where they are.  Examples of common configurations are in the
Makefile.lammps.* files.
