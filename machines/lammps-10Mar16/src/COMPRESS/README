This package provides alternative styles that allow compressed file I/O
via compression libraries. This is similar to what is enabled through
using the -DLAMMPS_GZIP preprocessor flag, but it does not open a pipe
to an external executable that handles the compression. These styles
use library calls to libraries like zlib instead and thus have to be
compiled using the library header files and linked to the respective
library. This provides an alternative for compressed file I/O on systems
where using a pipe can cause problems, e.g. when using RDMA communication
with pinned memory like clusters with Infiniband or Myrinet.

At the moment a few selected dump styles are supported
for writing via this packaging.
