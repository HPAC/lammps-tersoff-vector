This package contains a fix phonon command that calculates dynamical
matrices, which can then be used to compute phonon dispersion
relations, directly from molecular dynamics simulations.

See the doc page for the fix phonon command for detailed usage
instructions.

Use of this package requires building LAMMPS with FFT suppport, as
described in doc/Section_start.html.

There are example scripts for using this package in
examples/USER/phonon.

There is an auxiliary post-processing tool in tools/phonon that will
compute phonon frequencies and dispersion relations from the dynamical
matrices output by this command.

There is also an alternative code, dump2phonon, available which enables
one to use the functions of fix-phonon by reading in atom-style dump
files of lammps (which can be converted from the trajectories of any
other MD code):
