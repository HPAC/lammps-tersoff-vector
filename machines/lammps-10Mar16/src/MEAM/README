This package implements the MEAM potential as a LAMMPS pair style.

This package uses an external library in lib/meam which must be
compiled before making LAMMPS.  See the lib/meam/README file and the
LAMMPS manual for information on building LAMMPS with external
libraries.  The settings in the Makefile.lammps file in that directory
must be correct for LAMMPS to build correctly with this package
installed.

The person who created the MEAM library and this pair style is Greg
Wagner (while at Sandia, now at Northwestern U).
