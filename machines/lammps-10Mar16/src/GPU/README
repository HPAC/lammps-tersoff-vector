This package implements GPU optimizations of various LAMMPS styles.

This package uses an external library in lib/gpu which must be
compiled before making LAMMPS.  See the lib/gpu/README file and the
LAMMPS manual for information on building LAMMPS with external
libraries.  The settings in the Makefile.lammps file in that directory
must be correct for LAMMPS to build correctly with this package
installed.

The people who created this package are Mike Brown (while at Sandia
and ORNL) and Trung Nguyen (while at ORNL).
